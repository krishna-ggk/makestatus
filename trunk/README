Makestatus is developer oriented plasmoid which displays the make
progress in convenient manner.

MakeStatus comprises of plasmoid(applet), D-Bus enabled dataengine and
a make wrapper called makeinvoker which acts as an informer to
dataengine using d-bus calls.

To use it, you need all the three of the combo.

COMPILING INSTRUCTIONS
--------- ------------

cd <builddir>
cmake -DCMAKE_DEBUG_TYPE=debugfull -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>
make
make install


USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

If you don't reboot ensure you run the following commands to let know
plasma of the new plasmoid availability.

kquitapp plasma
kbuildsycoca4
plasma

After that, you can add the plasmoid as normally add.. Panel however
seems to be best place IMHO.

From now on, use 'makeinvoker' in place of make. You can pass the make
arguments to the makeinvoker as you used to pass it to make.



NOTE:
-----
This is my first plasmoid and has rough edges. So please excuse that :)
